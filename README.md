# simulation

A simulation in C using queues and linked lists<br>
written by: Kurt King 2015

Purpose:
    This program takes widgets from a file and runs simulations on them. The output of the program
    shows the statistics for each simulation. Judging by the statistics, the user would be able to
    specify which simulation is the most efficient.

Data Structures:
    This program implements linked lists and queues
