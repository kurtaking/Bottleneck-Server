# simulation

A simulation in C using queues and linked lists<br>
written by: Kurt King 2015

Purpose:
    This program takes widgets from a file and runs simulations on them. The output of the program
    shows the statistics for each simulation. Judging by the statistics, the user would be able to
    specify which simulation is the most efficient.

Specifications for running program:
    (Text needs to be updates)

Data Structures:
    This program implements linked lists and queues

Program Layout:
    simulationDriver.c
        (info coming soon)
    simulation.c
        (info coming soon)
    simulation.h
        (info coming soon)

Makefile:
    There is a general Makefile for the simulation.

    Once changes have been made to a file, simple run:
        $ make sim

    This will create the executable sim in your current directory
    Refer to running simulation to execute program
